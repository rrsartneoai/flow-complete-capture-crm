# Complete Capture CRM - System Architecture

## 1. Overview

The system leverages GoHighLevel (GHL) as the central workflow engine, orchestrating interactions with external services for OCR, e-signatures, and final data sinking into an external CRM. The user interaction primarily happens via GHL's messaging and forms.

```

```

## 2. Components

1.  **GoHighLevel (GHL):**
    *   **Workflows:** Core logic for the entire process, including conditional branching, delays, and triggers.
    *   **Messaging (SMS/Mobile-Friendly):** Primary communication channel with leads for outreach, verification, document requests, and reminders.
    *   **Forms/Surveys:** Used for initial data collection and potentially for uploading documents if GHL's file upload capabilities are leveraged.
    *   **Custom Fields:** Store lead data, document statuses, verification results, signature status, and CRM sync status.
    *   **Tags:** Segment users based on their stage in the workflow (e.g., `doc_id_pending`, `doc_id_verified`, `agreement_sent`, `complete`).
    *   **Triggers:** Initiate workflows based on lead actions (e.g., form submission, message reply) or internal events.

2.  **OCR Service (External or GHL Integrated):**
    *   Receives document uploads (potentially proxied via GHL or a temporary secure storage).
    *   Performs Optical Character Recognition.
    *   Verifies document type against expected types (ID, utility bill, bank statement, etc.).
    *   Checks for readability and potential fraud markers (if supported).
    *   Returns verification status and extracted data (if applicable) to GHL.

3.  **E-Signature Platform (External or GHL Native):**
    *   Receives data from GHL to pre-fill agreement templates.
    *   Sends agreement to the lead for electronic signature.
    *   Notifies GHL upon signature completion or declination.
    *   Provides the signed document (PDF) back to GHL or makes it accessible via API.

4.  **External CRM:**
    *   Receives finalized lead data, verified documents (or links), and the signed agreement from GHL via API or webhook.
    *   Serves as the system of record for completed leads.

5.  **Document Storage (Temporary/Permanent):**
    *   **GHL:** Can store uploaded documents in contact records.
    *   **Temporary External Storage (Optional):** If OCR service requires direct access or for staging large files before GHL ingestion. Must be secure.
    *   **Final Storage:** External CRM or a dedicated document management system linked to the CRM.

## 3. Data Flow & Key Workflows

### 3.1. Initial Outreach & Verification (Existing - to be reviewed)
1.  Lead enters system (e.g., via ad, webform).
2.  GHL: Initial SMS outreach.
3.  GHL: Lead replies, verification questions asked via GHL messaging.
4.  GHL: Lead status updated (e.g., `verified_lead`).

### 3.2. Multi-Step Document Collection
1.  **GHL:** Workflow triggers, requests first document (e.g., "Proof of ID") via GHL message, providing an upload link/method.
2.  **User:** Uploads document.
3.  **GHL:** Receives document. If direct upload to GHL, GHL triggers next step. If to external form, form submission triggers GHL.
4.  **GHL:** Sends document to OCR Service (e.g., via webhook or GHL's native function if available).
    *   *Alternative:* User uploads to a form connected to OCR service, which then webhooks GHL.
5.  **OCR Service:** Processes document, verifies type and readability. Returns result to GHL.
6.  **GHL:**
    *   **If Verified:** Update custom field (e.g., `doc_id_status = verified`), tag user (e.g., `doc_id_collected`). Request next document.
    *   **If Incorrect/Unreadable:** Update custom field (e.g., `doc_id_status = failed_ocr`), tag user (e.g., `doc_id_retry`). Send message to user requesting re-upload with specific instructions. Loop back to step 1 for this document.
7.  Repeat steps 1-6 for all required documents: Proof of Address, Bank Statement, Written Summary (text input or upload), Signed Authorization Form (this might be part of the e-signature step or a separate pre-auth).

### 3.3. Automated Agreement Delivery & Signature
1.  **GHL:** Workflow trigger once all documents are `verified`.
2.  **GHL:** Collects all necessary data from custom fields.
3.  **GHL:** Sends data to E-Signature Platform API to pre-fill and send the agreement.
    *   *Alternative (GHL Native):* GHL prepares and sends its native e-signature document.
4.  **E-Signature Platform:** Sends agreement to user for signature.
5.  **User:** Signs (or declines) the agreement.
6.  **E-Signature Platform:** Notifies GHL via webhook (e.g., `agreement_signed`, `agreement_declined`). Passes back signed document URL/file.
7.  **GHL:** Updates custom fields (e.g., `agreement_status = signed`, `signed_agreement_url = ...`), tags user (`agreement_signed`).

### 3.4. CRM Integration & Final Output
1.  **GHL:** Workflow trigger once `agreement_status = signed`.
2.  **GHL:** Gathers all verified lead data, document links/files, and signed agreement link/file.
3.  **GHL:** Makes an API call (or sends a webhook) to the External CRM, passing the collected information.
4.  **External CRM:** Receives data, creates/updates lead/contact record.
5.  **GHL:**
    *   **On successful CRM sync:** Update custom field (e.g., `crm_sync_status = success`), tag user (`flow_complete`, `synced_to_crm`).
    *   **On failed CRM sync:** Log error, notify admin, implement retry mechanism if appropriate. Tag user (`crm_sync_failed`).

### 3.5. Reminders & Follow-Ups
*   **GHL Workflows (Time-based & Event-based):**
    *   If a document is requested but not uploaded within X hours/days: Send SMS reminder.
    *   If an agreement is sent but not signed within X hours/days: Send SMS reminder.
    *   If a step fails (e.g., OCR multiple times): Escalate to manual review / notify admin.

## 4. Error Handling & Retries

*   **OCR Failures:** Provide clear feedback to the user and allow a set number of retries. After X retries, flag for manual review.
*   **API Call Failures (OCR, E-Sign, CRM):** Implement retry logic with exponential backoff within GHL workflows where possible. Log persistent failures for admin notification.
*   **User Inactivity:** Time-based reminders. After a certain period of inactivity at a critical step, potentially move lead to a "stale" or "follow-up needed" pipeline.

## 5. Security Considerations

*   Secure handling of API keys and credentials (use GHL's secure custom values/variables).
*   Ensure document uploads and storage (even temporary) are secure (HTTPS, access controls).
*   Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding PII in documents.
*   Regularly review access permissions in GHL and connected services.

# Complete Capture CRM - Tools, Platforms, and Services

This document lists the software, platforms, and services required or anticipated for the Complete Capture CRM project.

## 1. Core Platform

*   **GoHighLevel (GHL):**
    *   **Purpose:** Primary platform for workflow automation, CRM functionalities (internal), SMS/email communication, form building, user tagging, custom fields, and hosting landing pages/funnels if needed for document upload.
    *   **Access:** Full administrative access to the relevant GHL account is required.
    *   **Key Features Used:** Workflows, Triggers, SMS, Email, Custom Fields, Tags, Forms/Surveys, possibly native E-Signature.

## 2. External Services (Requires Selection & Integration)

*   **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Service:**
    *   **Purpose:** To verify document types (ID, utility bill, bank statement) and check readability. May also extract specific data if configured.
    *   **Candidates (Examples):**
        *   Google Cloud Vision API
        *   AWS Textract
        *   Nanonets
        *   Microsoft Azure Form Recognizer
        *   [Other GHL-compatible OCR services or native GHL OCR if available]
    *   **Requirements:** API Key, Sandbox/Testing Environment, Clear Documentation. Cost model to be considered.

*   **E-Signature Platform:**
    *   **Purpose:** To send pre-filled agreements (PDF or form) for electronic signature and capture the signed document.
    *   **Candidates (Examples):**
        *   DocuSign
        *   HelloSign (Dropbox Sign)
        *   PandaDoc
        *   SignNow
        *   GoHighLevel Native E-Signature (if capabilities meet requirements)
    *   **Requirements:** API Key, Sandbox/Testing Environment, Template Creation Capability, Webhook Support for status updates. Cost model to be considered.

*   **External CRM System:**
    *   **Purpose:** Final destination for all verified lead data, documents (or links), and the signed contract.
    *   **To Be Specified:** `[NAME_OF_EXTERNAL_CRM]` (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, etc.)
    *   **Requirements:** API Access (REST/SOAP), API Documentation, Webhook capabilities (optional, for GHL to send data), Sandbox/Development Environment.

## 3. Development & Testing Tools

*   **API Testing Tool:**
    *   **Purpose:** To test API calls to external services (OCR, E-Signature, CRM) and GHL's API/Webhooks during development.
    *   **Examples:** Postman, Insomnia.
*   **Text Editor / IDE:**
    *   **Purpose:** For writing notes, scripts (if any custom code is needed outside GHL, e.g., for a middleware webhook handler).
    *   **Examples:** VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++.
*   **Version Control (Recommended for Documentation & Assets):**
    *   **Purpose:** To track changes in documentation files, agreement templates (if stored as files), and any configuration exports.
    *   **Examples:** Git, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
*   **Communication & Collaboration:**
    *   **Purpose:** Team communication, task management, file sharing.
    *   **Examples:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, Asana, Trello, Google Workspace.

## 4. Document Management (Considerations)

*   **GHL:** Can store files attached to contacts.
*   **Secure Cloud Storage (Temporary/Staging - Optional):**
    *   **Purpose:** If a temporary holding place for documents is needed before OCR processing or if documents are too large for direct GHL handling via certain methods.
    *   **Examples:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage.
    *   **Note:** Must be configured securely.

## 5. GHL Specific Tools/Features to Leverage

*   **Workflow Builder:** For creating the automation sequences.
*   **Custom Values:** For storing API keys, endpoint URLs, and other global settings securely.
*   **Triggers & Actions:** The building blocks of GHL workflows.
*   **GHL's built-in Form/Survey builder:** For document uploads or text summaries if applicable.
*   **GHL Conversation API / Webhooks:** For more advanced integrations if needed.
